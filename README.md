# 🎮 Mini-Games in Rust

Welcome to my Rust mini-games collection! This project is a personal space where I improve my Rust skills by building small, often experimental games.

## ⚠️ Note

I'm using this project to explore new ideas, test patterns, and practice writing clean and efficient Rust code. Some of these games might be odd, overly minimal, or just plain strange — and that's intentional.

Expect:
- Unconventional mechanics
- Simple or no graphics
- Experiments with code structure, design, and Rust features
